# We will dissect this Quick Sort algorithm by first discussing its most important sub-routine: The O(N) partition (classic version).

# To partition A[i..j], we first choose A[i] as the pivot p.

# The remaining items (i.e., A[i+1..j]) are divided into 3 regions:

# 1. S1 = A[i+1..m] where items are â‰¤ p,
# 2. S2 = A[m+1..k-1] where items are â‰¥ p, and
# 3. Unknown = A[k..j], where items are yet to be assigned to either S1 or S2.

# This implementation is taken from neetcode's YouTube video on Quick Sort.
# print statements are added for better understanding of the algorithm
