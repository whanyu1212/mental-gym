# Given an array of N items and L = 0, Selection Sort will:
#
# 1. Find the position X of the smallest item in the range of [L...Nâˆ’1],
# 2. Swap X-th item with the L-th item,
# 3. Increase the lower-bound L by 1 and repeat Step 1 until L = N-2.

# The following implementation is taken from Prof Steven Halim's Course in NUS

# Print statements are added for better understanding of the algorithm

        smallest = L + A[L:].index(

        )  # BEWARE... this is O(N) not O(1)... we cannot find the smallest index of the minimum element of (N-L) items in O(1)
        print(f"Index of smallest element from index {L} onwards: {smallest}")
