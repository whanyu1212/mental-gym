# Edge list representation is particularly suitable for Bellman-Ford because:
# The algorithm needs to iterate over all edges repeatedly
# Edge list makes it easy to check negative cycles
# Memory efficient compared to adjacency matrix
# Simple to represent weighted edges

# There are also 5 special cases involving the SSSP problem.
# When we encounter any one of them, we can solve it with different and (much) faster algorithm than the generic O(VÃ—E)
# Bellman-Ford algorithm. They are:

# On Unweighted Graphs: O(V+E) BFS,
# On Graphs without negative weight: O((V+E) log V) Dijkstra's algorithm,
# On Graphs without negative weight cycle: O((V+E) log V) Modified Dijkstra's,
# On Tree: O(V+E) DFS/BFS,
# On Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG): O(V+E) Dynamic Programming (DP)
